# PreTrained-Image-Classifier
PreTrained Dog Image Classifier using Python

# Why I made this ?

Suppose there's a dog show going to occur in your city and you're going to volunteer in it. They give the department where you have to register dogs along with their characteristics such as color , size etc. Now there may be some mischevious people with cunning nature who would register dogs that aren't even dogs.So I made this classifier to know which are dogs and which aren't.And that along their breed classification

#To run this you will need:
1. Database of dogs
2. Python knowledge 
3. Time :)
